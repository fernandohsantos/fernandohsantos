#### ðŸ”¹ Classification of WGC and WGN Signals 

Abstract - The white Gaussian chaos (WGC) is a map that generates chaotic signals with the same power spectral density, autocorrelation sequence, statistical measures of position and dispersion of a white Gaussian noise (WGN) process. In this work, multilayer perceptron neural networks are used to determine whether a given signal was generated by a WGC or is a sample function of a WGN process. The nature of the WGC signal is exploited to optimize the network architecture. 

Keywords - discrete-time signals, chaos, neural networks.

#### ðŸ”¹ Separation of a Class of Chaotic and Random Signals Using Recurrence Plots

Abstract â€“ Chaotic signals can exhibit statistical characteristics similar to random processes, which makes their separation a challenging task. In this work, recurrence plots (RP) are employed to distinguish chaotic signals generated by the logistic map from stochastic signals produced by Gaussian distributions. The RP transforms time series into bidimensional visual patterns, allowing the identification of structured and deterministic features in chaos, in contrast to the unstructured distribution of random noise. The proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness of recurrence-based analysis as a simple and intuitive approach for the separation of chaotic and stochastic signals.

Keywords â€“ chaotic signals, recurrence plots, time series analysis.
