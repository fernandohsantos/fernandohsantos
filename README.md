#### ðŸ”¹ Classification of WGC and WGN Signals 

Abstract - The white Gaussian chaos (WGC) is a map that generates chaotic signals with the same power spectral density, autocorrelation sequence, statistical measures of position and dispersion of a white Gaussian noise (WGN) process. In this work, multilayer perceptron neural networks are used to determine whether a given signal was generated by a WGC or is a sample function of a WGN process. The nature of the WGC signal is exploited to optimize the network architecture. 

Keywords - discrete-time signals, chaos, neural networks.
